        <h1>The Journey of Our Energy-Efficient System: From Prototype to Future Developments</h1>

        <section class="intro">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>In our pursuit of creating an innovative energy-saving system, we embarked on a journey that began with a
            well-planned prototype and evolved through several stages of development. This blog details the process,
            highlighting key decisions and advancements that have shaped our project.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="prototype">
          <h2>Initial Prototype: Laying the Groundwork</h2>

          <h3>Sensor Selection</h3>
          <p>The first critical decision in developing our prototype was the choice of sensor. We opted for a standard
            ultrasonic sensor due to its ease of use, affordability, and high accuracy. Ultrasonic sensors are known for
            their reliability and efficiency, making them an excellent choice for our initial testing. Their ability to
            accurately measure distances while being cost-effective was crucial in allowing us to test our ideas without
            significant financial investment.</p>

          <h3>Microcontroller Choice</h3>
          <p>For the microcontroller, we selected the Arduino UNO. This decision was based on the Arduino UNO’s
            user-friendly coding environment, availability, and its ability to meet our current requirements. Its
            straightforward programming interface and widespread community support made it a practical choice for
            prototyping. The Arduino UNO allowed us to effectively manage the sensor data and control various
            components, ensuring that we could test and refine our system efficiently.</p>

          <h3>Circuit Board Design</h3>
          <p>In our prototype, we used a standard breadboard. The decision to use a breadboard rather than soldering
            components onto a permanent circuit board was driven by the need for flexibility during the prototyping
            phase. A breadboard allowed us to easily modify and adjust our circuit design without the risk of permanent
            changes. This approach facilitated quick testing and iteration, helping us identify and resolve issues
            before committing to a final design.</p>

          <h3>System Functionality</h3>
          <p>The primary function of our prototype was to count the number of entries and exits in a room. To achieve
            this, the ultrasonic sensors were strategically placed at doorways. The Arduino UNO processed the sensor
            data and used it to toggle lights and fans based on the number of people detected. The system utilized high
            and low signals to control these components, providing a basic but effective demonstration of the concept.

          <h2>Transition to Future Developments</h2>

          <h3>Advanced Sensor Selection</h3>
          <p>For the next phase, we chose to integrate PIR (Passive Infrared) and mmWave (millimeter-wave) sensors. The
            mmWave sensors use radio waves to measure distances, offering higher accuracy and the ability to detect
            motion without requiring a direct line of sight. However, they are prone to false positives, which can
            affect their reliability. On the other hand, PIR sensors, while less accurate and requiring a line of sight,
            have very low false positive rates. By combining these two technologies, we aim to achieve a high level of
            accuracy in detecting movement and occupancy, leveraging the strengths of each sensor type to minimize their
            individual limitations.</p>

              class="sensor-link">mmWave Sensor Info</a>.</p>

          <h3>Microcontroller Upgrade</h3>
          <p>To manage the increased complexity of our system, we selected the Raspberry Pi 3 B as our microcontroller.
            The Raspberry Pi 3 B is capable of handling a large number of modules and communicating with various
            microcontrollers and servers. Its advanced processing power and versatility make it well-suited for managing
            the more sophisticated requirements of our enhanced system. Additionally, we plan to incorporate ESP32
            modules for server communication, providing robust connectivity and enabling seamless data exchange between
            the system components and our server infrastructure.</p>

          <h3>Circuit Board Enhancement</h3>
          <p>For the circuit board, we opted for a general-purpose dotted circuit board. This choice provides the
            flexibility to customize the circuit board layout as needed. Unlike pre-designed circuit boards, a dotted
            circuit board allows for easy adjustments and modifications, ensuring that we can tailor the design to meet
            our evolving needs and integrate new components effectively.</p>

          <h3>Data Display and Implementation</h3>
          <p>In the final stage of our project, we will focus on displaying the collected data, including the amount of
            electricity saved, the reduction in costs, and the overall impact of the project. This information will be
            showcased on a dedicated webpage hosted on a personal server. The webpage will provide real-time insights
            into the system’s performance, offering users a clear view of the benefits achieved through our
            energy-saving measures. By presenting this data, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system and
            its potential for broader application.</p>
